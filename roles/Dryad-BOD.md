# Dryad Board of Directors

[Dryad](https://datadryad.org) is a repository for sharing datasets underlying science publications. The Dryad BoD provides "provide strategic planning, fiscal oversight, and oversee the position of the Executive Director. Members also approve any amendments to the organization’s Bylaws, have the opportunity to steer policies and features, and are kept abreast of emerging issues in data publishing." -- https://datadryad.org/pages/organization
I was nominated for the BoD in May, elected June, to start 3 years service in August 2019.

I was elected based on the following materials:

## BIO:
As Associate Director of ASAPbio, a non-profit organisation promoting transparency and innovation in life sciences communication, Naomi is leading activities to engage the research community to promote the productive use of preprints in biology. She navigates the relationships between publishers, funders, researchers and consumers of science in order to drive innovation in the communication of life sciences research. Naomi is a CEFP2019 fellow with the AAAS’s Community Engagement Fellowship Programme, run by Lou Woodley and colleagues at the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement. She learns and contributes to open science advocacy and innovation as an OpenCon alumnus, Mozilla Science community contributor and through advisory and organising roles with multiple open science projects (OpenAsInBook club; PREreview) and events (ResearchObject 2018 workshop; Open Access week 2018; OpenCon 2017). Prior to joining ASAPbio, Naomi worked as Innovation Officer (2016-2018) and Events Coordinator (2016) with eLife, and was a Wellcome Trust science policy intern with the Academy of Medical Sciences in the UK. Naomi graduated with a PhD in Clinical Biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in 2017.

## PERSONAL STATEMENT:
Anyone can make a discovery about the world we live in when they have access to information, training, resources, opportunities and support. I believe that the best science develops from productive peer-to-peer interactions and that it takes intentional action to be inclusive and equitable. This is why I value open science processes that are inclusive, people-centred and equitable and that celebrate collaboration, diversity and joyful engagement. I am committed to working with others to make this the default experience.

Through my current work coordinating community-driven advocacy for the use of preprints in biology, I seek to help researchers see beyond their immediate frustrations to envision a system where collaboration and peer-to-peer support are paramount, and where multiple stakeholders — researchers, publishers, funders, research consumers, patients and beyond — share in the mission of discovery in science and technology. To work that advances open science as a paradigm shift, I bring my understanding of the realities, strengths and limitations of science publishing and alternatives.

Dryad is a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved when a community gets together to tackle a shared frustration. It is important to me that grassroots initiatives to improve science succeed, can be sustained as non-profit organisations and continue to act as inspiration to other grassroots organisers. I would be excited to contribute to the future of Dryad as an engaged and proactive board member.
