## Application (main body)

### Project/idea

**At the Innovation Sprint, I would like to work on...**
*Please tell us briefly which problem(s) you would like to address in relation to research communication, open science, and/or applying the latest technologies to research and discovery.*
*(100 words)*

OR IF APPLYING AS PROJECT LEAD:

**Project/idea**
*Please describe the project/idea you would like to pursue at the Sprint. Please tell us about the motivation behind the idea, what you hope to achieve at the Sprint, and what skill sets you are looking for in your team. Feel free to include any relevant links to Github repositories/websites.*
*(300 words)*

*[I applied as project lead so responded to the second question]* The paucity of research evaluation processes that directly and fairly reward research integrity, reproducibility and excellence underpins many of the challenges we face in science today. Journal prestige/Impact Factor continue to dominate as time-efficient surrogate metrics despite well-known insufficiencies. With preprints, science could be curated and evaluated in a more dynamic, transparent and equitable way than traditional journal gatekeeping mechanisms (known to be subject to multiple biases), allowing the incentives of reputation and funding to align with open science principles. With 3000 new biology preprints posted every month and no magic extra time available, the challenge is in deciding which to read, review, curate and recognise. The visibility of a preprint today is largely determined by the size of the authors’ Twitter network and pre-existing name recognition (in the absence of journal name): with preprints in biology, we risk perpetuating the same research evaluation challenges that stymie a more open and collaborative research enterprise. And to avoid widening existing inequalities, we must ensure systems that encourage attention on preprints are designed to recognise and support the less-visible, including smaller subject areas and work by authors negatively affected by bias (whether career stage, gender, ethnicity, geography and/or institutional affiliation). Lists of female and BAME scientists have helped promote more diverse conference speaker representation: following suit, there is already a twitter bot that retweets preprints posted by female first authors (https://sbotlite.github.io/). However, there are also bots/tools highlighting preprints that have already attracted the most social attention (https://github.com/wdecoster/PromisingPreprint; [rxivist.org](https://rxivist.org)). I propose we prototype an easy, time-efficient way to identify and suggest for review preprints that may otherwise go unnoticed; I seek technological and design contributions from developers, data scientists, editors and prospective users (e.g. developers/contributors to PREreview, PreLists/PreLights, europePMC).


### Your skills and experience
*Please specify other skills of relevance that you would share at the event, or add detail to explain any of the skills listed above, such as specifying programming languages, technical skills, area of research, and listing years of experience. Include any relevant links, such as your website and/or Twitter, Github and/or LinkedIn pages.*
*(200 words)*

My mission is to make preprinting a valuable, enjoyable and productive experience for all -- author or reader, well-connected established scientist or new postdoc, active academic or citizen scientist. At this crucial point (growth inflection?) in the adoption of preprints in biology, this is far from guaranteed.

Regarding this project idea: by September, I hope to have access to a cross-server database of preprint authors and affiliations (produced in collaboration with the ScholCommLab), which could be used to generate an easy way to identify preprints that may otherwise go unnoticed. I already have access to the PostGRES database provided by Rxivist and a dump of the SHARE database from earlier this year, so those may be fallback options (where permitted) if no multi-server data available.

To the sprint, I would also bring:
-- Information about preprints and connections with relevant project leads (through role at asapbio.org and twitter:@npscience)
-- Understanding of DEI issues through exposure from OpenCon conferences, research and ongoing discussions in multiple communities
-- Experience of design, strategy, project and community management (e.g. https://blog.cscce.aaas.org/an-agile-community-strategy-or-how-to-use-okrs-to-say-no-and-stay-focused/; https://medium.com/@npscience/getting-ahead-of-the-curve-as-a-community-manager-922dfc3d0f6f)
-- A commitment to produce something tangible and informative


### I am interested in participating in the Innovation Sprint because…
*Please tell us briefly what you hope to gain from participating in the event.*
*(100 words)*

This a rare opportunity to collaborate in-person with preprint project leads, developers, editors and people committed to ensuring diversity, equity and inclusion are guiding principles for open science innovations. Technological tinkering is insufficient: this problem requires pragmatic input from people who understand DEI issues in publishing and peer review. Further, any product that improves the visibility of research contra to existing social biases would be most tractable if designed for use by people contributing to projects that highlight and curate preprints — Rxivist, Plaudit, PREreview, PreLists/Prelights, EuropePMC — whom the eLife Sprint is likely to attract.


### Tell us about something you have created that you are proud of:
*Please share the story of an idea you have prototyped or brought to fruition before, what you contributed and learned, and why you are proud of this. The idea does not need to relate to the scope of this event, but we are particularly interested in contributions to any open (source or science) projects!*
*(100 words)*

Are you ready for meta? I am honestly most proud of organising last year’s eLife Sprint. Tasked with prototyping the first eLife hackathon, I managed to combine personal priorities (fun, inclusion, respect) with organisational objectives (productive, impactful, relevant to open science innovation) in a way that I previously found challenging. However, I had intended to organise, contribute and reflect more openly and collaboratively than I did — I’d bring this frustration and another year’s experience and learning in open leadership to the Sprint to help me concisely document and productively share my work for others to understand and build on.

### Have you been or are you currently involved with eLife?
*Please list any associations with eLife, such as being a participant at last year's Sprint, an eLife Ambassador or ECAG member, involvement in a project or initiative supported by eLife, or having worked directly with us before. We may take this into account when selecting between highly rated applications; other factors are of higher priority.*
