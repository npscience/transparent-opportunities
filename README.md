# transparent-opportunities
Sharing my applications for event participation and talks, professional positions and roles, and other opportunities in open science, wherever possible. Because transparency aids accountability and equity of access to opportunity. I hope to keep this up-to-date with results too, either way -- ask me if you spot an entry missing an outcome (that you might reasonably expect to have one by that time).
