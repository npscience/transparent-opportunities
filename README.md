# transparent-opportunities
Sharing my applications for [event participation and talks](/events), [professional positions and roles](/roles), [fellowships or learning opportunities](/training), wherever possible. Because transparency aids accountability and equity of access to opportunity. I hope to keep this up-to-date with results too, either way -- ask me if you spot an entry missing an outcome (that you might reasonably expect to have one by that time).
